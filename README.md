## 1.   Introduction

Our main aim was to create a small and simple pilot system that would be adaptable and harmonious enough for possible future expansion. This ultimately depended on the quality and sustainability of the system that was developed. Woodlands University College (WUC) is a higher education institution currently looking for a computerized course management system for their computing degree course. The course leader Dr. Simon White desires the new system to replace the current clerical system and manage the records of students and staff more efficiently. The system will also contain features such as module management, assignment management, attendance records etc.

## 2.	Project aims and objectives

The main aims and objective of this project is to build a computerized course management system for computing degree at Woodland University College. The system will be able to store records of students, tutors, and courses. The website will consist of a login system which will further allow each assigned role with specific features and access within the system.

## 3.	Project development methodology:

•	Identify problem domains and come up with definitive solutions to counter it.
•	Prepare a project management system to tackle individual aspects within the project as milestones and deliverables using the web-based list-making application Trello.
•	Elicit interviews with the stakeholders to get a better understanding of the system requirements.
•	Compare and review similar systems.
•	Design and create wireframes and mockups for the system.
•	Formulate flowcharts based on the systems requirements and features.
•	Program the system as per the designed wireframes and mockups:
	Use JavaScript and its implementations for much of the frontend with frameworks like React for the interface design and other features and runtime environments like Node.js for the execution of the code beyond the browser.
	Use MySQL for functionalities related to the database and storage of information pertaining to the system.
•	Elucidate the designs of the proposed system to the stakeholder and deploy after both parties are satisfied with the final product.
